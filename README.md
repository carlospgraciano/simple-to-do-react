# Simple to-do react app

This project was made as a practice to learn how to use React. I intended to use hooks and JSX (which is new to me).

## Setup
In case you want to run this project all you need to do is:

1. **Clone** this repository repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/carlospgraciano/simple-to-do-react`
2. **Make** sure you have NPM installed because [NPX](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/) will be used: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. **Go** to the cloned directory: `cd {Path to the repository}`
3. **Run**: `npx browser-sync start --server --files "./*.html" --no-open --no-notify --directory`
